        digital gardens. This website is built with Next.js and hosted on
        Vercel. It's <a href={siteConfig.REPO_URL}>open source</a>.

        I like teaching people things that I know. I like video games, running,
        and reading.

        I am easily impressed by people and the cool stuff that they build. I
        read a lot of personal and technical blogs. If we've ever interacted,
        I've visited your website and probably think it's cool!

        I currently lead a team of three software engineers building very cool
        things for the web! Lately, I've been focusing on improving the
        observability of our systems and keeping things fast!
