          . Lately, I've been interested in chess engines, programming language interpreters, and
          digital gardens. This website is built with Next.js and hosted on
          Vercel. It's <a href={siteConfig.REPO_URL}>open source</a>.

          I like teaching people things that I know. I like video games,
          running, and reading.

          I am easily impressed by people and the cool stuff that they build. I
          read a lot of personal and technical blogs. If we've ever interacted,
          I've visited your website and probably think it's cool!
        </p>
        <h2>Things I Like (continued)</h2>
        <p>Technical books I recommend include Grokking Algorithms, Crafting Interpreters, Classic Computing Problems in Python, and The Computational Beauty of Nature.</p>
        <p>Non-tech authors I recommend include Patricia Lockwood and Ben Lerner. In my undergrad, I mostly studied post-WWII fiction.</p>
        <p>I like being outside and prefer cold days. I enjoy the rain.</p>
        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>I'm a software engineer at Vercel.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>M.S.c. in Computer Science (Distinction)</li>
          <li>B.A. in Creative Writing (with First Class Honours)</li>
