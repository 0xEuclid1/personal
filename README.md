## healeycodes.com

My personal website, blog, portfolio, and experimentation ground. My home on the web. A collection of software miscellanea.

This is version 3 of my website. A plain Next.js website with limited dependancies.

## Open source

I will read all issues/PRs and welcome any changes or suggests that improve this project. However, I can't provide support for running or maintaining this code. 

Please do not copy/publish my writing (e.g. `posts`) — this project doesn't have a license (contact me if this causes you problems) because I still need to write a split license that covers code/code snippets vs. posts.

<br>

## Use case

To share things that I learn/do!

I write posts in plain Markdown with images. These posts have code snippets that require code highlighting — for this I use the relatively lean `prism-react-renderer`.

My call-to-action is a newsletter sign-up powered by Buttondown.

GoatCounter provides [privacy friendly](https://www.goatcounter.com/gdpr) analytics. I use analytics to find forums where my posts have been shared so that I can join in/learn from the discussion.

## Design

I kept this version plain. There's one font (Inter) and limited colors.

The goal was a maintainble design (focused on content) that let me move fast e.g. there isn't a design system.

## Dev

`next dev`

<br>

## Build/Run

`next build`
`next start`

<br>

## Tests

TODO.

Currently deciding between unit tests, Cypress, or a mixture.
